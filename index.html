        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Here are some projects that the Proffessional Learning Community of 2017-18 worked on. Their main focus was <strong>water</strong></p>

            <h3>Desalinization</h3>
                <p>My research concerning water desalination analyzes various different water 
                    desalination techniques and how each dynamic process could potentially confront 
                    the growing problem of water shortages across the globe. After much research I 
                    found four main techniques of water desalination: Thermal Desalination, Reverse 
                    Osmosis (RO), Forward Osmosis (FO), and Electrodialysis (ED). The majority of my 
                    research investigated each of the four main water desalination techniques. Each 
                    process has its pros and cons in structure and mechanism that made certain 
                    processes more useful then others in different areas of the world. Membrane 
                    Desalination (MD) is a relatively new technique and as new technologies continue 
                    to be introduced these processes are becoming more cost efficient. In order for 
                    an effective water desalination technique to be achieved the process would not 
                    only have to be efficient, but most importantly, economically friendly.
                     My research for water desalination started out slow, but as I dug into what was 
                     out there a found loads of intriguing information. Ever since I was little I have a
                     lways have wanted to become and engineer of some sort, but was never sure exactly what I woul
                     d do as an engineer. This research project opened up my eyes to a whole new world of engineer
                     ing that is fighting to confront a growing epidemic of water shortages. Creating new, more co
                     st efficient, and even life saving techniques of water desalination is definitely something th
                     at I could see myself doing coming out of college in a few years. </p>

            <h3>Different Technologies Water Website</h3>
                <p>We created a website to help people conserve more water, but in a more reason
                    able approach. Our goal was not to tell people that they should never flush y
                    our toilet or take only minute showers. No instead we gave information on the
                     different water conserving technologies and landscaping techniques that can e
                     asily be install/implemented that will save water. People will no longer need 
                     to keep all those simple tips memorized that only save a drop of water, they n
                     ow have a resource that allows them to save gallons of water with out the hassle.</p>

            <h3>Educating and Presenting to Young Kids</h3>
                <p>We presented how to minimize water usage and why that is important. It is im
                    portant to establish this mindset into young children so that they can continue 
                    to use the new skills they’ve learned in the future. As a group, we came togethe
                    r and prepared an appropriate presentation for the children about methods that ca
                    n be intertwined into their daily lives to reduce water usage. We included activ
                    ities and helpful tips in this presentation.  Some simple and easy ways that you
                    ng kids can start saving water from home and out side.  We taught them easy ways 
                    they can make a difference such as; turning off the faucets while brushing their 
                    teeth, tightly turning off the faucets so water doesn’t drip, don’t flush if it’s
                     number one, bath time for babies, and watering the grass with reusable water.  O
                     verall, our main objective was to spread awareness by informing and presenting t
                     o young elementary school students on how to get involved and help preserve water.</p>
