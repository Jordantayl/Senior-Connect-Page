    <h2>What Makes the Professional Learning Community different from the Service Connect?</h2>
    <h3>FIELDTRIPS</h3>
<p> Being apart of the Proffessional Learning Community allows students to engage outside 
    of the ordinary teaching settings and get a feel for objectives taught in class, in the real
    world! The Professional learning community has had fieldtrip opportunities in the past that included the Utah 
    State Wetlands, several trips to the Loveland Living Aquarium, and lastly the West Jordan
    Observation Gardens. Each of these fieldtrips have encompassed indepth understanding of the 
    objectives taught in class. 
</p>
    <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
<p> Unlike the Service Connect, continuous assignments are not the primary focus.
    The Professional Learning Community is focused on individual and group projects. Many of 
    these projects are engaging. Being hands on means that students are constantly being wired to communicate, think, and create! 
    Projects in class, and outside of class have allowed for this hands on learning to take place. </p>
